# Hello, World!
The first program that every programmer writtes is the Hello World Program.
This program shows you the text "Hello World" on your Terminal.

* **1**: Create a new file called ```hello.fox```
* **2**: Write to following code to the file:

```python
print "Hello, World!"
```

* **3**: Now execute the following command:

```
$ fox -i hello.fox -o hello
$ ./hello
```

Now you will see something like this:

```
Hello, World!
```

## Challange
Change the program so that instead of ```Hello, World!``` the text ```Hello, Fox!``` indicates.
